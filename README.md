# Vue Loading Skeleton Effect

This is a Vue component that generates a loading skeleton effect, which is a visual effect that signifies the loading of data. The effect is created by animating a gradient across the location where the data will ultimately appear. The gradient initially appears as solid and then gradually becomes transparent, giving the impression of a loading skeleton effect.

PS, I used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Props

The Vue Loading Skeleton Effect component has the following props:

| Prop         | Description                                    | Type   | Default |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| shimmerColor | The color of the moving gradient.              | String | #FFFFFF |
| bgColor      | background color of the loading shimmer effect | String | #9CA3AF |

### Reference

This component was inspired by the article "[Skeleton Loader using Vue & Tailwind](https://dev.to/kouts/skeleton-loader-using-vue-tailwind-422a)" by **[Konstantinos Koutsogiannis](https://github.com/kouts)**.
